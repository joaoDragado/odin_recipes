  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>A Spanish desert delicacy, one that can be compared to the french creme caramel and the italian panacotta</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>one 8-10oz (300-400ml) can Sweetened Condensed Milk
    </li>
    <li>water to cover</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><p>Prepare the pressure cooker by adding the trivet and steamer basket. Place the can on the steamer basket, being careful that it does not touch the sides or base of the pressure cooker. Do not skip this step. The can not be in direct contact with the super-heated base or sides of the pressure cooker.</p></li>
    <li><p>Fill the pressure cooker with enough water to cover the can. Put the can on its side to make sure it is fully submerged while not exceeding the "maximum capacity" of the pressure cooker</p></li>
    <li><p>Close the lid and set the valve to pressure cooking position.</p></li>
    <li><p>Stovetop pressure cookers: Lock the lid and cook for 20 minutes at high pressure.When time is up, open the pressure cooker with the Natural release method - move the cooker off the burner and wait for the pressure to come down on its own. </p></li>
    <li><p>When the pressure cooker unlocks, do not remove the lid. Delicately set the pressure cooker aside and let it cool overnight - do not remove the can from the cooker or attempt to open it while it is warm.</p></li>
    <li><p>The next day, when completely cool, the can can be stored as-is or opened to used in your favorite recipe. Transfer to a plastic container and freeze any un-used portion for up to three months.</p>
      <p>If the dulce de leche is too stiff, simply warm the desired amount in a small pan with a spoon or two of milk to soften it to the desired consistency.</p></li>
